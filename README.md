A repository of information related to the Green version of the STM32 Black Pill. I purchased this board from Amazon, but it is likely avaliable from other vendors.

## Pinout
The naming of these pins are rather intuitive with the pin numbers being in order, as opposed to some other boards where the numberings are seemingly more random.
